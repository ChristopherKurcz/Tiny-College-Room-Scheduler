# Tiny College Room Scheduler
 CMPSC 221 Final Project. Room scheduling application for a fictional college

 Room Scheduler Final Phase:

 You have been asked to develop a Room Scheduling application for Tiny College. This college has only one building in which to schedule rooms. The Tiny College reserves one room per Date per faculty, for each Date the rooms are available. The rooms are reserved by Faculty name. Faculty can request a room reservation for a specific Date based on the number of seats they require. The room will be assigned by the program, faculty do not get to request a specific room. Each Date is just a specific Date. Faculty are identified by a single name. 

This application should have a very nice GUI interface and will be a database driven application. The database used will be Derby. This application must use good Object Oriented Design and Programming. The database must use good Object-Oriented Design and Programming. There is a very close correlation between Object-Oriented Design and Database Design. Your application design should include at least four classes besides the main GUI class, e.g. Faculty member class, Room class, Date class..., Reservations class etc. Your database accesses should be in the classes that correlate with the database tables.
